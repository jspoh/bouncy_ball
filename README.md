ball that bounces, controlled with arrow keys


First program I created with the use of classes. Credits to github.com/ldinghan for helping me lol i was so confused about how classes work.

This was kind of confusing to make at first because of my poor knowledge of classes but it became clearer as I was finishing it.

This program has a ball that can:
- Jump
- Bounce of the walls and floor
- Move around
- Different friction multipliers on the ground and air
- Acceleration when you hold down the arrow key[left/right only]

Actually pretty proud of this :D
